Change the approach: shift from predicting individual future
prices to forecasting an integrated information entity
encompassing both past and future prices.

We need to integrate future price information with past price
information into a unified framework.

Method: PCA-Principal Component Analysis

Future data points are projected by these
eigenvectors, effectively distributing them
into a transformed space where each
dimension (eigenvector) encodes a distinct
pattern of variability.
